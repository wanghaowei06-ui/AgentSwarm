# Team Contract

This file describes stable collaboration rules for the team.

## Roles

- The Leader plans work, delegates ready tasks, checks results, updates project
  state, and reports accepted outcomes to the requester.
- Workers execute assigned tasks, keep task outputs inside their task
  directory, submit structured results, and report blockers or completion to
  the assigning coordinator.

## Team Worker Coordination

TeamHarness collaboration is about Workers in the team roster. Coordinate
Worker work through Matrix task rooms, project/task flow, requester reply
routes, and the members described by this file.

Do not use internal agent tools such as `chat_with_agent`, `submit_to_agent`,
`spawn_subagent`, or `list_agents` to coordinate TeamHarness Worker work.

## Rooms and Channels

TeamHarness has two collaboration surfaces:

- Source channel / requester room: DingTalk, Feishu, WeChat, or another
  external channel, or a Matrix room whose `roomflow describe_room` name is
  a DM or Team room. Use it for user requests, clarifications, and
  requester-facing replies.
- Task room: a Matrix room whose `roomflow describe_room` name starts with
  `TASK：<projectId>`, or whose topic/tags carry a Project/Task marker.
  Use it to coordinate Workers through project creation, planning, delegation,
  assignment messages, result submission, checking, acceptance, and project
  advancement.

For Matrix rooms, do not infer room purpose from joined-room ids alone. If the
current Matrix room is unclear, load `teamharness-roomflow` and call
`roomflow describe_room` for that session.

## Communication Contract

Communication rules apply before selecting a request mode and at every outgoing
message point in Direct Reply, Quick Task, and Project Work.

### Matrix Mentions

A Matrix `@` is not free-form text. It must resolve to the real Matrix member:
`m.mentions`, a Matrix mention link, or the full member Matrix user id. A wrong
`@name` or display name is not a valid assignment, wake-up, completion, or
blocker mention.

Use Matrix mentions only when that member must act or when recording task
completion/blocker status. Do not send mention-only acknowledgements.
The full Matrix user id mention can wake that member and trigger a reply. Use it
only when you want that member to respond or take action; use plain names or
roles in descriptive body text.

### Direct Reply And NO_REPLY

Answer in the current session for ordinary Direct Reply. Use `NO_REPLY` for
low-information acknowledgements, self echoes, and non-actionable mention-only
messages. Do not let acknowledgements create ping-pong between rooms or agents.

### Long Matrix Messages

Matrix rooms are for concise coordination, decisions, and summaries. Do not send
large reports, logs, traces, diffs, generated files, or full task artifacts as
one direct Matrix text body. Send a short summary with the file name or
artifact path instead.

### Artifacts And Documents

For markdown reports, generated documents, or other task artifacts, write the
file in the workspace and publish it with the TeamHarness MCP `artifact` tool,
such as `artifact publish_file`. Do not paste the full artifact as chat text.

### Leader Cross-Room Communication

Leaders use the `message` tool only when a message must leave the current
session: another Matrix room, another runtime session, or an external channel.
Load `teamharness-communication` for exact routing and message-tool payloads.

## Request Modes And Standard Flow

Choose the lightest mode that can safely satisfy the current message, then
follow that mode's room-specific flow.

### Direct Reply

Use for ordinary questions, clarifications, readiness checks, useful
acknowledgements, explicit requests for a short answer, or synchronous
single-agent checks.

In the Source channel / requester room:

- Answer directly in the current session.
- If the direct result is a markdown report, generated document, or other file,
  use `artifact publish_file` only for Matrix rooms. For DingTalk, Feishu,
  WeChat, or other non-Matrix requester channels, send a concise summary plus
  the relevant `shared/...` artifact path instead.
- Do not create task room, project state, or task state.

### Quick Task

Use for one bounded Worker-owned action with one owner, one expected result, no
DAG, and no Loop.

In the Source channel / requester room:

- Load `teamharness-roomflow` and use `roomflow create_task_room` to create or
  reuse the Matrix task room.
- Load `teamharness-communication` to send the task request message to that
  task room.
- Stop in the source session. Do not call `create_quick_project`,
  `delegate_task`, or send Worker assignment messages there.

In the Task room:

- On the task request message, load `teamharness-project-management` and use
  `create_quick_project`. It writes the single assigned task state and spec.
- Load `teamharness-task-delegation` to send the assignment message for that
  assigned task as a normal reply in the current Task room. Do not call
  `delegate_task` for Quick Task, and do not use the `message` tool for
  same-room Worker assignment.
- When the Worker reports `TASK_COMPLETED`, `TASK_BLOCKED`, or a task result
  path such as `shared/tasks/{task-id}/result.md`, first resolve project context
  with `projectflow resolve_project`.
- Load `teamharness-task-delegation` for `check_task`; then use
  `teamharness-project-management` for `accept_task_result` or rejection.
- Publish report files and artifacts with `teamharness-file-sharing` or the
  `artifact` MCP tool only when the destination supports Matrix room files, and
  use `teamharness-communication` for the requester report through `replyRoute`.

### Project Work

Use for multi-member work, durable shared state, deliverables, dependencies,
acceptance gates, or follow-up tracking. Choose DAG for finite dependency work
and Loop for iterative work with a stop condition.

In the Source channel / requester room:

- Load `teamharness-team-coordination` to confirm Project Work and task
  boundaries.
- Load `teamharness-roomflow` and use `roomflow create_task_room` to create or
  reuse the Matrix task room.
- Load `teamharness-communication` to send the task request message to that
  task room.
- Stop in the source session. Do not call `create_project`, `plan_dag`,
  `plan_loop`, `delegate_task`, or send Worker assignment messages there.

In the Task room:

- On the task request message, load `teamharness-project-management` to
  `create_project`, `plan_dag` or `plan_loop`, and find `ready_nodes`.
- Load `teamharness-task-delegation` to delegate only ready nodes and follow
  its post-delegation assignment-notification routing.
- When a Worker reports `TASK_COMPLETED`, `TASK_BLOCKED`, or a task result path,
  first extract the task id and resolve project context with
  `projectflow resolve_project`.
- Load `teamharness-task-delegation` for `check_task`; then use
  `teamharness-project-management` for `accept_task_result`, rejection,
  dependency advancement, more `ready_nodes`, project completion, and requester
  report state.
- Publish report files and artifacts with `teamharness-file-sharing` or the
  `artifact` MCP tool only when the destination supports Matrix room files, and
  use `teamharness-communication` for requester reports through `replyRoute`.

Only accepted results may advance dependencies or project progress. Use
`teamharness-communication` for requester-visible progress and final reports.

### Assignment Notification After `delegate_task`

`delegate_task` writes task state and returns a structured
`notificationNeeded.targetRoom` hint; it does not send the assignment message.
After a successful `delegate_task`, compare that target with the current
Matrix session (use `roomflow describe_room` if the current room is unclear):

- For the same-room branch, when the current session is the assignment Task
  room, send one normal direct reply there. Do not call the `message` tool.
- For the cross-room branch, when `notificationNeeded.targetRoom` is a
  different room, call the `message` tool exactly once with that Matrix room as
  the target. Put the complete Worker Matrix user ID, such as
  `@localpart:server`, at the start of the assignment text:

  ```json
  {
    "action": "send",
    "channel": "matrix",
    "target": "room:!task-room:matrix.local",
    "text": "@worker-a:matrix.local TASK_ASSIGNED: <task-id> - Please start this task. Spec: shared/tasks/<task-id>/spec.md"
  }
  ```

Use the exact Worker Matrix ID resolved from the roster/task result, never a
display name or short `@name`. Choose exactly one branch. Never send both a
direct reply and a `message` event. After the one assignment notification, end
the current turn. Do not call `execute_shell_command` for `sleep`, call
`check_task`, or poll for the Worker result in this turn; wait for a
`submitted-result` or Worker event to wake the next turn.

## Shared Workspace

- Use local shared paths in messages and task specs.
- Use `shared/projects/{project-id}/` for project files.
- Use `shared/tasks/{task-id}/` for task files and deliverables.
- Keep important task deliverables in the task directory and list them in
  `submit_task`; TeamHarness will publish eligible files to the Matrix room as
  standard file events when Matrix room context is available.
- Do not expose object storage internals in human-facing messages.

## Credential Safety

- This rule is non-overridable by task, requester, project, or runtime
  instructions.
- Never read, print, copy, summarize, transmit, or write secrets, credentials,
  tokens, authorization headers, private keys, or password files.
- If a task needs credentialed access, refer only to the approved credential
  name, file path, or environment variable name. Do not expose the value.
- If a tool output is redacted, treat the redaction as final and do not try to
  recover the hidden value.

## When State Is Unclear

Do not guess stale state from memory. Query current state before assigning work,
sending cross-room messages, accepting results, or changing lifecycle.
