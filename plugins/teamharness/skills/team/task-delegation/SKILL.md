# Task Delegation

Use this skill when acting as Leader to create Project Work task specs, send
assignment messages, and check submitted Worker results.

Each delegated task should have a task id, owner, scope, expected deliverables,
acceptance criteria, and blocker reporting path. Write task instructions to the
shared task directory before asking the owner to execute.

A submitted result is only a candidate result until accepted by the Leader.
Do not use this skill to turn ordinary conversation into tasks.

## Scope

Use this skill for:

- `taskflow` calls as Leader
- converting a ready project node into a Worker task spec
- checking a submitted Worker result
- routing task assignment and completion messages

Use `teamharness-project-management` to create projects, plan DAG or Loop work,
resolve ready nodes, record Loop iteration decisions, and accept results into
project progress.

## Delegate Only Ready Nodes

Use `delegate_task` only for Project Work nodes that are ready in project
state. Do not create bare tasks directly from a user request. First create or
update a project DAG, then delegate a ready project node returned by
`projectflow` `readyNodes`, or create/update a Loop and delegate a ready
project node returned by `readyLoopNodes`.

For Quick Task, `projectflow` `create_quick_project` is used instead. It
already writes `shared/tasks/{task-id}/meta.json`,
`shared/tasks/{task-id}/spec.md`, and marks the task `assigned`; do not call
`delegate_task` again for that task. After it returns `ok: true`, send the same
assignment message you would send after `delegate_task`.

Before delegation:

1. Resolve the Worker Matrix ID or stable member name from the team roster.
2. Confirm the node came from `readyNodes` or `readyLoopNodes`.
3. Write a bounded task spec through `taskflow`. The spec must include the
   completion report instruction below.
4. Keep Worker deliverables under `shared/tasks/{task-id}/...`. Do not ask a
   Worker to write or submit `shared/projects/...`; project reports are Leader
   owned.
5. Use the current Matrix Task room for the assignment. Do not fall back to
   the requester/source session.
6. Mention the assigned Worker in the Task room only after
   `delegate_task` succeeds.

`teamharness-roomflow` owns task-room creation, reuse, external source binding,
and Worker invites before Project Work reaches this skill.

## Delegate Task

Call `taskflow` with `role: "leader"` and pass `payload` as an object:

```json
{
  "role": "leader",
  "action": "delegate_task",
  "payload": {
    "projectId": "demo-project-001",
    "taskId": "demo-project-001-01",
    "roomId": "room:!task-room:matrix.local",
    "spec": "# Task demo-project-001-01\n\n## Context\nExplain why this task exists.\n\n## Expected Result\nCreate deliverables under shared/tasks/demo-project-001-01/ and submit a result with STATUS, SUMMARY, and DELIVERABLES.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- The result addresses the task scope.\n- Deliverables are listed in result.md.\n\n## Completion Report\nAfter `taskflow submit_task` returns `ok: true`, reply in the current Task room and mention the exact Leader Matrix user from this task context:\n\n<Leader Matrix user> TASK_COMPLETED: demo-project-001-01 - Result: shared/tasks/demo-project-001-01/result.md\n\nDo not use `NO_REPLY` after a successful task submission.\n"
  }
}
```

`delegate_task` writes:

```text
shared/tasks/{task-id}/meta.json
shared/tasks/{task-id}/spec.md
```

It also changes the project node status to `assigned`.

## Post-Delegation Assignment Notification

`delegate_task` returns a structured `notificationNeeded.targetRoom` hint; the
tool does not send the assignment message. After `delegate_task` returns
`ok: true`, compare that target with the current Matrix session, using
`roomflow describe_room` if the current room is unclear.

- Same-room: if the current session is the assignment Task room, send one
  normal direct reply in that room. Do not call the `message` tool.
- Cross-room: if `notificationNeeded.targetRoom` differs from the current
  session, call the official `message` tool exactly once, targeting that Matrix
  room. The text must start with the complete Worker Matrix user ID resolved
  from the roster/task result, for example `@localpart:server`:

  ```json
  {
    "action": "send",
    "channel": "matrix",
    "target": "room:!task-room:matrix.local",
    "text": "@worker-a:matrix.local TASK_ASSIGNED: <task-id> - Please start this task. Spec: shared/tasks/<task-id>/spec.md"
  }
  ```

Use exactly one branch. Never send both the direct reply and the cross-room
`message` event. After the one assignment notification, end the current turn.
Do not call `execute_shell_command` for `sleep`, call `check_task`, or poll for
the Worker result after delegation. Wait for a `submitted-result` or Worker
event to wake a later turn.

## Task Spec Completion Report

Every delegated task spec must include this final instruction, with the task id
and result path adjusted for the actual task:

```text
## Completion Report

After `taskflow submit_task` returns `ok: true`, reply in the current assignment
room and mention the exact Leader Matrix user from this task context:

<Leader Matrix user> TASK_COMPLETED: demo-project-001-01 - Result: shared/tasks/demo-project-001-01/result.md

Do not use `NO_REPLY` after a successful task submission.
```

If the project node already contains a custom completion line, preserve it and
still make the Leader mention requirement explicit.

## Assignment Message

For the same-room branch, after `delegate_task` or `create_quick_project`
returns `ok: true`, send one normal current-session reply in the Task room and
mention the Worker:

```text
@worker-a:matrix.local TASK_ASSIGNED: demo-project-001-01 - Please start this task. Spec: shared/tasks/demo-project-001-01/spec.md
```

Do not use the `message` tool for this same-room assignment. The direct Task
room reply is the trigger; using `message` plus a direct mention can trigger
the Worker twice. For a cross-room `delegate_task`, follow
Post-Delegation Assignment Notification and do not also send this direct reply.

Do not ask the Worker to edit project files. Do not ask several Workers to own
the same task directory.

## Check Submitted Task

When a Worker reports completion or blocker status, call:

```json
{
  "role": "leader",
  "action": "check_task",
  "payload": {
    "taskId": "demo-project-001-01"
  }
}
```

If `effective` is false, do not accept the task. Tell the Worker what is
missing and wait for a corrected result.

If `effective` is true, return to `teamharness-project-management` and decide
whether to accept the result into project progress.

## Result Contract

Worker results should contain:

```text
STATUS: SUCCESS
SUMMARY: Short summary

DELIVERABLES:
- shared/tasks/{task-id}/path
```

For report-style tasks, the Worker may write the full report directly to
`shared/tasks/{task-id}/result.md` before calling `submit_task`. The tool
records structured status in task metadata and does not create or rewrite
`result.md`. Do not treat `result.md` as only a short envelope when it is the
expected deliverable.

Accepted statuses are:

- `SUCCESS`
- `SUCCESS_WITH_NOTES`
- `REVISION_NEEDED`
- `BLOCKED`

Submitting a result ends that Worker task. If more work is needed, create a new
project node and delegate a new task.

## Post-Action Notification

`delegate_task` and `submit_task` return a `notificationNeeded` field when they
succeed. This field is a structured hint — the tool does not send any message
automatically.

For `delegate_task`: follow Post-Delegation Assignment Notification. The
same-room direct reply is the one notification when the target is the current
Task room; when `notificationNeeded.targetRoom` differs, the one official
cross-room `message` send is mandatory. The hint itself never sends a message.

For `submit_task`: the Worker completion message in the Task room already serves
as the notification to the Leader. The `notificationNeeded` field confirms the
target room for this report.

The Leader should check `notificationNeeded` after accepting a task result to
determine whether a requester report or downstream notification is due. See
`teamharness-project-management` Post-Action Notification for the full
protocol.
