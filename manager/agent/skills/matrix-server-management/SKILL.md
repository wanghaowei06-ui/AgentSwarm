# Matrix Server Management

Manage the Tuwunel Matrix Homeserver at `${AGENTTEAMS_MATRIX_URL}`. User ID format: `@<username>:${AGENTTEAMS_MATRIX_DOMAIN}`.

## Gotchas

- **Workers IGNORE messages without `m.mentions`** — they have `requireMention: true`. You MUST include `m.mentions.user_ids` with the full Matrix user ID for Workers to process the message (MSC3952)
- **User IDs in body text and `m.mentions.user_ids` must match exactly** — partial or mismatched IDs cause silent failures
- **`trusted_private_chat` preset auto-joins all invited members** — no invite acceptance needed
- **Matrix accounts cannot be deleted via API** — reuse the same username on reset
- **Do NOT use this skill for Worker/project creation** — `create-worker.sh` and `create-project.sh` handle Matrix operations internally
