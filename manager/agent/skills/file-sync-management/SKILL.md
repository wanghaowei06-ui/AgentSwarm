# File Sync Management

## Gotchas

- **Local `/root/agentteams-fs/` is NOT real-time synced** — you must explicitly pull from MinIO
- **After writing to `/root/agentteams-fs/`, immediately push to MinIO** + notify Worker to file-sync via @mention
- **When Worker says they pushed files, pull before reading** — never assume local copy is current
- **`mc mirror` uses `--overwrite`; single file uses `mc cp`**
