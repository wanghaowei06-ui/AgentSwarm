# Channel Management

Manages communication channels, admin identity recognition, trusted contacts, and primary channel configuration.

## Gotchas

- **Primary channel cannot be set to "matrix"** — Matrix DM is the default fallback. Use `--action reset` to revert to it
- **Unknown senders in group rooms must be silently ignored** — no response at all, until admin explicitly approves them as trusted contacts
- **Trusted contacts must never receive sensitive info** — no API keys, tokens, passwords, Worker credentials, or internal config. No management operations either
- **When calling `message` tool from a Matrix session, you MUST explicitly set `channel` and `target`** — otherwise the message goes to the current Matrix room instead of the primary channel
- **`to` field in primary-channel.json maps to `target` parameter in `message` tool** — pass the value directly, no transformation needed
- **First-contact protocol: always ask in admin's language** — match the language they used in their message
- **Task dispatch must go to Worker Room, not admin DM** — when assigning tasks to Workers, use the task-management skill's send protocol (runtime-aware: `agt get managers -o json` for runtime, then message tool or `copaw channels send` per finite/infinite references). Never embed @worker task assignments in admin DM replies.
