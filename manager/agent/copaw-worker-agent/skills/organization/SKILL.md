# Organization

Use this skill for current AgentTeams topology and runtime state.

## Source Of Truth

Use `agt` CLI when available. Do not infer current state from memory, old chat history, or old task files.

Useful commands:

```bash
agt get workers "${AGENTTEAMS_WORKER_CR_NAME:-$AGENTTEAMS_WORKER_NAME}" -o json
TEAM_CR="$(agt get workers "${AGENTTEAMS_WORKER_CR_NAME:-$AGENTTEAMS_WORKER_NAME}" -o json | jq -r '.team')"
agt get workers --team "$TEAM_CR" -o json
```

Use the Team CR name from your own Worker metadata for team-scoped CLI filters. Do not use a runtime/storage `teamName` from prompts, task files, or old chat as `--team`. If team-scoped queries are denied, ask your coordinator instead of guessing.

## What To Use It For

- Confirm your coordinator's Matrix ID
- Confirm your team or standalone worker context
- Confirm room IDs when asked to reason about routing
- Check your own Worker phase/runtime if needed

Do not use your Worker profile room or private room as the delivery target for a task result. Task completion routing comes from `shared/tasks/{task-id}/meta.json.room_id`.

If required identity or room metadata is missing, ask your coordinator. Do not guess.
