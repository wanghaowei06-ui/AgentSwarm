# Find Skills

This skill helps you discover and install skills from the open agent skills ecosystem.

## Security Assurance

**Worker is completely isolated and cannot access any admin's personal sensitive data.** You can safely search and install skills from public or private registries. The skills you install only run within your isolated container environment.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user:

- Asks "how do I do X" where X might be a common task with an existing skill
- Says "find a skill for X" or "is there a skill for X"
- Says "import xxx skill from market", "install xxx skill from market", or otherwise explicitly asks you to import a skill from the market
- Asks "can you do X" where X is a specialized capability
- Expresses interest in extending agent capabilities
- Wants to search for tools, templates, or workflows
- Mentions they wish they had help with a specific domain (design, testing, deployment, etc.)

## What is the Skills CLI?

The Skills CLI (`skills`) is the package manager for the open agent skills ecosystem. Skills are modular packages that extend agent capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools.

If `skills` command is not found, install it: `npm install -g skills`

Always use this fixed script path for this skill. Do not rely on a relative `scripts/` path from your current directory:

```bash
FIND_SKILLS_SCRIPT="/home/openhuman/.openhuman/skills/find-skills/scripts/agentteams-find-skill.sh"
```

**Key commands:**

- `"${FIND_SKILLS_SCRIPT}" find [query]` - Search for relevant skills
- `"${FIND_SKILLS_SCRIPT}" install <skill>` - Install a skill
- `skills check` - Check for skill updates
- `skills update` - Update all installed skills

**Browse skills at:** https://skills.sh/

## Environment Variables

```bash
SKILLS_API_URL  # Skills registry API endpoint (default: nacos://market.agentteams.io:80/public)
```

Can be configured by admin to point to an enterprise-private registry.

## How to Help Users Find Skills

### Step 1: Understand What They Need

When a user asks for help with something, identify:

1. The domain (e.g., React, testing, design, deployment)
2. The specific task (e.g., writing tests, creating animations, reviewing PRs)
3. Whether this is a common enough task that a skill likely exists

### Step 2: Search for Skills

Run the find command with a relevant query:

```bash
"${FIND_SKILLS_SCRIPT}" find [query]
```

For example:

- User asks "how do I make my React app faster?" → `"${FIND_SKILLS_SCRIPT}" find react performance`
- User asks "can you help me with PR reviews?" → `"${FIND_SKILLS_SCRIPT}" find pr review`
- User asks "I need to create a changelog" → `"${FIND_SKILLS_SCRIPT}" find changelog`

> **Critical**: Always use the exact install command shown in search results.
> Never guess or shorten the package name or command, because that may fail.

### Step 2A: Direct Market Import Requests

If the user already gave you a concrete skill name and asked to import it from the market, you can install it directly:

```bash
"${FIND_SKILLS_SCRIPT}" install <skill>
```

### Step 3: Present Options to the User

When you find relevant skills, present them to the user with:

1. The skill name and what it does
2. The install command they can run (copy exactly from search results)
3. A link to learn more at skills.sh

### Step 4: Offer to Install

If the user wants to proceed, you can install the skill for them:

```bash
"${FIND_SKILLS_SCRIPT}" install <skill>
```

## Skill Resources

`/home/openhuman/.openhuman/skills/find-skills/scripts/agentteams-find-skill.sh` is the resource that belongs to this skill. Always invoke that exact path (or the `FIND_SKILLS_SCRIPT` variable above) instead of `scripts/agentteams-find-skill.sh`, so your command does not depend on the current directory.
