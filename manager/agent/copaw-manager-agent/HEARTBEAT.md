## Manager Heartbeat Checklist (QwenPaw Runtime)

This checklist is for the QwenPaw Manager runtime. Every send into a Matrix **group** room (Worker room, Leader room, project room) or admin notification **must** go through **`copaw channels send`** via the shell tool (see **QwenPaw Message CLI Reference** at the end).

**Hard rules (heartbeat sends — same intent as AGENTS.md Gotchas):**
- **Workers do not see admin DMs.** Status pings, overdue triggers, and task follow-ups belong in the correct Matrix room via `copaw channels send`, using the room id from the task entry, project `meta.json`, or `agt get workers -o json`. Do not rely on admin-facing text alone.
- **`--target-session`** is the literal Matrix room id (no `room:` prefix). **`--target-user`** is the full Matrix id of the Worker or Team Leader you @mention in `--text`. Use single-quoted `--text '...'` so `@` mentions survive the shell.

### 1. Read state.json

Read state.json (local only, no sync needed). If the file does not exist, initialize it first:

```bash
bash /opt/agentteams/agent/skills/task-management/scripts/manage-state.sh --action init
cat ~/state.json
```

The `active_tasks` field in state.json contains all in-progress tasks (both finite and infinite). No need to iterate over all meta.json files.

**Ensure admin notification channel is available** (used in Step 7):

1. Check `admin_dm_room_id` in state.json. If `null`, discover it now:
   - List joined rooms, find the DM room with exactly 2 members: you and `@${AGENTTEAMS_ADMIN_USER}:${AGENTTEAMS_MATRIX_DOMAIN}`
   - Persist it:
     ```bash
     bash /opt/agentteams/agent/skills/task-management/scripts/manage-state.sh \
       --action set-admin-dm --room-id "<discovered-room-id>"
     ```
2. Verify the channel is resolvable:
   ```bash
   bash /opt/agentteams/agent/skills/task-management/scripts/resolve-notify-channel.sh
   ```
   If the output shows `"channel": "none"`, the admin DM room discovery above may have failed — retry or log a warning.

---

### 2. Check Status of Finite Tasks

Iterate over entries in `active_tasks` with `"type": "finite"`:

- Read `assigned_to`, `room_id`, and `project_room_id` (if present) from the entry
- Determine the target room: use `project_room_id` if available, otherwise use `room_id`
- **Before sending any message**, ensure the Worker's container is running:
  ```bash
  bash /opt/agentteams/agent/skills/worker-management/scripts/lifecycle-worker.sh \
    --action ensure-ready --worker {worker}
  ```
  The script outputs JSON with a `status` field:
  - `ready` — container was already running, proceed normally
  - `started` — container was stopped and has been woken up; **wait 30 seconds** for the Worker to initialize before sending the follow-up message
  - `recreated` — container was missing and has been recreated; **wait 60 seconds** before sending the follow-up message, and flag this anomaly for the admin report (Step 7)
  - `remote` — legacy lifecycle status meaning the container is not managed through the Manager-local container API; assume the controller/backend owns readiness
  - `failed` — could not start/recreate the container; **skip the follow-up message**, flag the anomaly for the admin report (Step 7), and suggest the admin intervene
- **Use `copaw channels send` via shell** to send a follow-up to that room:
  ```bash
  copaw channels send \
    --agent-id default \
    --channel matrix \
    --target-user "@{worker}:${AGENTTEAMS_MATRIX_DOMAIN}" \
    --target-session "{room_id}" \
    --text "@{worker}:${AGENTTEAMS_MATRIX_DOMAIN} How is your current task {task-id} going? Are you blocked on anything?"
  ```
- Determine if the Worker is making normal progress based on their reply
- If the Worker has not responded (no response for more than one heartbeat cycle), flag the anomaly in the Room and notify the human admin (see Step 7)
- If the Worker has replied that the task is complete but meta.json has not been updated, proactively update meta.json (status → completed, fill in completed_at), and remove the entry from `active_tasks`:
  ```bash
  bash /opt/agentteams/agent/skills/task-management/scripts/manage-state.sh --action complete --task-id {task-id}
  ```

---

### 2b. Check Team-Delegated Tasks

Iterate over entries in `active_tasks` that have a `delegated_to_team` field:

- These tasks are managed by Team Leaders, NOT individual workers
- Read `assigned_to` (the Team Leader name) and `room_id` (the Leader Room)
- **Ensure the Team Leader's container is running**:
  ```bash
  bash /opt/agentteams/agent/skills/worker-management/scripts/lifecycle-worker.sh \
    --action ensure-ready --worker {leader}
  ```
- **Use `copaw channels send` via shell** to send a follow-up to the Leader room:
  ```bash
  copaw channels send \
    --agent-id default \
    --channel matrix \
    --target-user "@{leader}:${AGENTTEAMS_MATRIX_DOMAIN}" \
    --target-session "{room_id}" \
    --text "@{leader}:${AGENTTEAMS_MATRIX_DOMAIN} How is task {task-id} progressing? Any blockers from your team?"
  ```
- **Do NOT contact team workers directly** — the Team Leader handles internal coordination
- If the Team Leader reports completion, process it the same as a regular worker completion
- If the Team Leader reports a blocker, escalate to admin (Step 7)

---

### 3. Check Infinite Task Timeouts

Iterate over entries in `active_tasks` with `"type": "infinite"`. For each entry:

```
Current UTC time = now

Conditions (both must be met):
  1. last_executed_at < next_scheduled_at (not yet executed this cycle)
     OR last_executed_at is null (never executed)
  2. now > next_scheduled_at + 30 minutes (overdue)
```

If conditions are met:

1. **Ensure the Worker's container is running** before triggering:
   ```bash
   bash /opt/agentteams/agent/skills/worker-management/scripts/lifecycle-worker.sh \
     --action ensure-ready --worker {worker}
   ```
   If `status` is `failed`, skip the trigger and flag the anomaly for the admin report (Step 7). If `started` or `recreated`, wait for the Worker to initialize (30s / 60s respectively).

2. Read `room_id` from the entry and **use `copaw channels send` via shell** to trigger execution:
   ```bash
   copaw channels send \
     --agent-id default \
     --channel matrix \
     --target-user "@{worker}:${AGENTTEAMS_MATRIX_DOMAIN}" \
     --target-session "{room_id}" \
     --text "@{worker}:${AGENTTEAMS_MATRIX_DOMAIN} It's time to run your scheduled task {task-id} \"{task-title}\". Please execute it now and report back with the keyword \"executed\"."
   ```

**Note**: Infinite tasks are never removed from active_tasks. After the Worker reports `executed`, **only** update `last_executed_at` and `next_scheduled_at` — do NOT @mention the Worker again:
```bash
bash /opt/agentteams/agent/skills/task-management/scripts/manage-state.sh \
  --action executed --task-id {task-id} --next-scheduled-at "{new-ISO-8601}"
```

**CRITICAL**: Triggering and recording are independent actions. Heartbeat triggers execution when the schedule says it's time. Recording happens when the Worker reports back. Never re-trigger a Worker immediately after recording — the next execution will be triggered by a future heartbeat when `next_scheduled_at` is due.

---

### 4. Project Progress Monitoring

Scan plan.md for all active projects under /root/agentteams-fs/shared/projects/:

```bash
for meta in /root/agentteams-fs/shared/projects/*/meta.json; do
  cat "$meta"
done
```

- Filter projects with `"status": "active"`
- For each active project, read `project_room_id` from meta.json, then read plan.md and find tasks marked as `[~]` (in progress)
- If the responsible Worker has had no activity during this heartbeat cycle, **ensure the Worker's container is running first** (`lifecycle-worker.sh --action ensure-ready --worker {worker}`), then **use `copaw channels send` via shell** to send a follow-up to the project room:
  ```bash
  copaw channels send \
    --agent-id default \
    --channel matrix \
    --target-user "@{worker}:${AGENTTEAMS_MATRIX_DOMAIN}" \
    --target-session "{project_room_id}" \
    --text "@{worker}:${AGENTTEAMS_MATRIX_DOMAIN} Any progress on your current task {task-id} \"{title}\"? Please let us know if you're blocked."
  ```
- If a Worker has reported task completion in the project room but plan.md has not been updated yet, handle it immediately (see the project management section in AGENTS.md)

---

### 5. Capacity Assessment

- Count the number of `type=finite` entries in state.json (finite tasks in progress) and identify idle Workers with no assigned tasks (neither finite nor infinite)
- If Workers are insufficient, check in with the human admin about whether new Workers need to be created
- If Workers are idle, suggest reassigning tasks

---

### 5b. Drain Pending Worker Greetings

If `~/pending-workers.json` exists, the previous admin DM turn(s) finished early after `agt create worker --no-wait` and deferred the post-creation polling/greeting to you. Process every entry:

```bash
test -s ~/pending-workers.json || true
```

For each entry (one JSON object per line):

1. Look up current status:
   ```bash
   PHASE=$(agt get workers -o json | jq -r --arg n "<NAME>" '.[] | select(.name==$n) | .phase // "Unknown"')
   ```
2. **`Pending`** and queued < 90s ago — leave the entry, drain again next heartbeat.
3. **`Pending`** and queued > 90s ago — flag the anomaly to admin in DM (Step 7) and remove the entry using the drain helper below.
4. **`Failed`** — read the worker's `message` field, notify admin in DM with the failure reason, remove the entry using the drain helper below.
5. **`Running`** — fetch `roomID` from `agt get workers -o json`, greet the Worker, then notify admin in DM that the Worker is up:
   ```bash
   ROOM_ID=$(agt get workers -o json | jq -r --arg n "<NAME>" '.[] | select(.name==$n) | .roomID // empty')
   bash /opt/agentteams/agent/skills/worker-management/scripts/send-worker-greeting.sh \
     --worker "<NAME>" --room "${ROOM_ID}"
   # Then notify admin via copaw channels send to the resolved admin DM room:
   #   "<NAME> is now Running and greeted in their Worker room."
   ```
   Remove the entry from `~/pending-workers.json` after successful greeting + notify using the drain helper below.

Never run `rm`, `unlink`, `mv`, or any inline rewrite command for `~/pending-workers.json`; Tool Guard may pause the Admin DM session and block later admin requests. Keep the file, even if it becomes empty. To remove a processed entry, call the helper:

```bash
bash /opt/agentteams/agent/skills/worker-management/scripts/drain-pending-worker.sh --worker "<NAME>"
```

---

### 6. Worker Container Lifecycle Management

Only execute when the container API is available (check first):

```bash
bash -c 'source /opt/agentteams/scripts/lib/container-api.sh && container_api_available && echo available'
```

If the output is `available`, proceed with the following steps:

1. Sync status:
   ```bash
   bash /opt/agentteams/agent/skills/worker-management/scripts/lifecycle-worker.sh --action sync-status
   ```

2. Detect idle Workers and auto-stop those that have exceeded the timeout:
   ```bash
   bash /opt/agentteams/agent/skills/worker-management/scripts/lifecycle-worker.sh --action check-idle
   ```
   For each Worker that was auto-stopped, run `agt get workers <name> -o json` to get its `roomID` and **use `copaw channels send` via shell** to log:
   ```bash
   copaw channels send \
     --agent-id default \
     --channel matrix \
     --target-user "" \
     --target-session "{worker_room_id}" \
     --text "Worker {name} container has been automatically paused due to idle timeout. It will be automatically resumed when a task is assigned."
   ```

---

### 7. Report to Admin

**All heartbeat findings MUST be sent to the admin via `copaw channels send`** (not as a reply in the current heartbeat context).

- If all Workers are healthy and there are no pending items: HEARTBEAT_OK (no message needed)
- Otherwise, **read SOUL.md first** — use the identity, personality, and **user's preferred language** defined there when composing the report. Report in that language and tone.
- Resolve the notification channel:
  ```bash
  bash /opt/agentteams/agent/skills/task-management/scripts/resolve-notify-channel.sh
  ```
  The script outputs JSON with `channel`, `target`, and `via` fields.

  - When `channel` is **`matrix`**: set `--target-session` to the room id from `target` after stripping a leading `room:` prefix if present. Set `--target-user` to the admin's full Matrix id `@${AGENTTEAMS_ADMIN_USER}:${AGENTTEAMS_MATRIX_DOMAIN}`. Run:
    ```bash
    copaw channels send \
      --agent-id default \
      --channel matrix \
      --target-user "@${AGENTTEAMS_ADMIN_USER}:${AGENTTEAMS_MATRIX_DOMAIN}" \
      --target-session "<room_id_without_room_prefix>" \
      --text "@${AGENTTEAMS_ADMIN_USER}:${AGENTTEAMS_MATRIX_DOMAIN} [Heartbeat Report] <summarize findings and recommended actions, in SOUL.md persona and language>"
    ```
    If the summary contains characters that break double-quoted `--text`, switch to single-quoted `--text` and type the admin Matrix id literally inside the string.
  - When `channel` is **not** `matrix` and not `"none"`: use **`copaw channels send`** with the resolved `channel` and `target` per **channel-management** / **primary-channel** skill references for that channel.
  - If `channel` is **`"none"`**: admin DM room has not been discovered yet — attempt discovery now (see Step 1), then retry.

## QwenPaw Message CLI Reference

For QwenPaw runtime, use the following CLI command format to send messages:

```bash
copaw channels send \
  --agent-id default \
  --channel matrix \
  --target-user "<user_id for mentions>" \
  --target-session "<room_id>" \
  --text "<message content>"
```

Key parameters:
- `--agent-id`: Always `default` for Manager agent
- `--channel`: Always `matrix` for Matrix protocol
- `--target-user`: The Matrix user ID for @mentions (e.g., `@worker:matrix.domain`)
- `--target-session`: The Matrix room ID (e.g., `!roomid:matrix.domain`)
- `--text`: The message content

To query available sessions:
```bash
copaw chats list --agent-id default --channel matrix
```
