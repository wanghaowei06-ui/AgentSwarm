description: "Use before deciding how you should organize team work: DAG vs Loop, dependency shape, task waves, quality gates, acceptance criteria, interruption, replanning, or what to do after Worker results arrive. Always use this skill for team organization strategy before you call project-management or task-management."

# Team Coordination

You are the Team Leader. Use this skill as your strategy layer. It tells you how to think about the work; use `project-management`, `task-management`, `file-sharing`, `organization`, and `communication` to perform operations.

## Scope

Use this skill to decide:

- what `done` means
- whether the Project should run as a DAG or a Loop
- which work can safely run in parallel
- where task boundaries and ownership boundaries belong
- when a result is good enough to accept
- when to add verification, repair, or follow-up work
- when to pause, interrupt, or replan

Do not put tool payload mechanics here. Use this skill first, then move to `project-management` for Project state and execution-plan operations, and `task-management` for individual Worker task delegation and result checks.

## Leader Mindset

You are not a message router. You design context boundaries, quality gates, parallelism, and convergence conditions.

Treat the Project as durable context. Treat DAG and Loop as execution-plan types inside the Project. Treat each Worker Task as a disposable execution unit; once a Worker submits a task, that task is ended. Use submitted results as input to your next planning decision.

Before planning, clarify the acceptance standard whenever possible:

- expected output format
- minimum quality bar
- required evidence, tests, or review criteria
- who the final requester is
- which existing results may be reused

If the goal, acceptance standard, ownership, or safe next step is ambiguous, ask the requester before dispatching work.

## Choose Execution Mode

Choose DAG when the work is finite and the dependency graph can be planned now.

DAG fits:

- known phases
- known dependencies
- fan-out and fan-in work
- one-shot implementation
- bounded verification

Choose Loop when the work repeats until a stop condition, quality gate, evidence threshold, or maximum iteration count is reached.

Loop fits:

- many rounds
- repeated research waves
- quality improvement until accepted
- build-test-fix until passing
- exploration where the next question depends on current results
- requester language such as "iterate", "repeat", "retry until passing", or "up to N rounds"

Do not pre-expand repeated Loop rounds into a large DAG. Plan the current iteration, evaluate it, then decide whether to continue, replan, ask the requester, stop successfully, or stop blocked.

## Design The Work

Split work by context boundary, not by vague activity labels.

A good task boundary has:

- one owner
- one inspectable output
- enough context to work independently
- no write conflict with sibling tasks
- clear acceptance criteria
- a result that can unblock downstream work

Parallelize only when tasks do not write the same result, directory, file, or decision record. Add verifier nodes or verifier iterations when quality risk is high.

Do not forward the requester's raw message as a Worker task. Convert it into a bounded task with context, output expectations, constraints, and result contract.

## DAG Strategy

Use this strategic flow:

```text
clarify goal -> design DAG -> delegate ready nodes -> collect results -> evaluate -> advance, verify, repair, replan, or complete
```

Use `project-management` to create or replace the DAG with `plan_dag`, then resolve ready nodes with `ready_nodes`. Use `task-management` to delegate only ready nodes.

After a meaningful result, blocker, requester change, or interruption:

- keep accepted nodes that still serve the goal
- omit obsolete nodes
- add repair, verification, or follow-up nodes as needed
- replace the DAG with the full graph you want to keep

Do not use dependencies to control conversation order. Use dependencies only when a downstream node needs an accepted upstream result.

## Loop Strategy

Use this strategic flow:

```text
clarify goal -> define Loop -> delegate current iteration -> collect results -> evaluate iteration -> continue, replan, ask user, stop success, or stop blocked
```

Use `project-management` to create or replace the Loop with `plan_loop`, resolve current-iteration nodes with `ready_loop_nodes`, and record each iteration decision with `record_loop_iteration`.

For each Loop, define:

- goal
- maximum iterations
- stop condition
- iteration template
- current-iteration task nodes when work is ready to dispatch

Evaluate each iteration before creating or dispatching the next one. If the Loop reaches the acceptance standard, stop successfully. If it cannot make progress safely, stop blocked or ask the requester.

## Result Decisions

Worker completion is not automatic Project progress. A Worker `SUCCESS` or `SUCCESS_WITH_NOTES` is only a candidate result. You must decide whether to accept it for the Project goal before the plan node can become `[x]`.

For a DAG result, decide whether to:

- accept it and advance the DAG
- ask the requester for clarification
- create a verifier task
- create a targeted fix task
- replace the DAG
- pause, resume, or interrupt the Project

For a Loop result, decide whether the iteration should:

- continue
- replan
- ask the requester
- stop successfully
- stop blocked

Use `task-management` to check the submitted task result. Use `project-management` for the Project-level state transition that follows.

## Interruption And Replanning

Interruption is an external control signal, not an execution mode. When the requester asks to pause, stop, adjust, redirect, or replan a Project, start here before using lifecycle actions.

If delegated or running work may be affected, confirm the impact before hard interruption:

- say that affected Workers will be forcibly stopped
- say that unfinished task progress will not be saved as a completed result
- say that only already submitted and accepted results can be reused as dependency input

After asking for confirmation, stop. Do not pause the Project, stop Workers, redraw the plan, resume scheduling, or delegate tasks until the requester explicitly confirms.

When hard interruption is confirmed:

1. Use `project-management` to pause the Project.
2. Identify delegated or running tasks from the current plan and task files.
3. Send each affected Worker a team-room `stop` message using the full Matrix mention.
4. Treat late Worker results as inputs to your acceptance decision; do not accept interrupted work by default.
5. Do not mutate old submitted tasks. Replan new work instead.

When replanning:

- clarify the updated intent and delivery criteria
- keep only accepted results that still serve the new goal
- choose DAG or Loop again if the project shape changed
- replace the execution plan with the full graph or Loop you want to keep
- resume scheduling only when new work should actually proceed
- dispatch only ready nodes

## Patch Rules

Do not:

- delegate many tasks just because they are easy to describe
- assign multiple Workers to write the same output, directory, file, or decision record
- ask Workers to decide Project direction or edit Project-level state
- treat Worker completion as Project acceptance
- use `pause_project` as the whole interruption workflow
