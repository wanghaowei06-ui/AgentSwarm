# Declarative Resource Management

AgentTeams uses Kubernetes CRD-style declarative YAML to manage platform resources — **Worker**, **Team**, **Human**, and **Manager**. You describe the desired state, and the AgentTeams Controller handles creation, updates, and deletion automatically.

## Core Concepts

### Organization Structure

AgentTeams uses a three-tier organization that maps to real enterprise team structures:

```
Admin (Human administrator)
  │
  ├── Manager (AI Agent, management entry point)
  │     ├── Team Leader A (special Worker, coordinates team tasks)
  │     │     ├── Worker A1
  │     │     └── Worker A2
  │     ├── Team Leader B
  │     │     └── Worker B1
  │     └── Worker C (standalone Worker, not part of any Team)
  │
  └── Human Users (real people, access based on permission level)
        ├── Level 1: Admin-equivalent, can talk to all roles
        ├── Level 2: Can talk to specified Teams' Leaders + Workers
        └── Level 3: Can only talk to specified Workers
```

### Four Resource Types

| Resource | Description | Underlying Entity |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Worker | AI Agent execution unit | Docker container + Matrix account + MinIO space |
| Team | Collaboration group referencing one Leader Worker and N member Workers | Worker references + Team Room |
| Human | Real human user | Matrix account + Room permissions |
| Manager | Coordinator Agent (task routing, Worker/Team orchestration) | Manager Agent runtime (same stack as Workers; reconciled like other CRs) |

All resources share a unified API version: `apiVersion: agentteams.io/v1beta1`.

**kubectl short names** (when CRDs are installed): `wk` (Worker), `tm` (Team), `hm` (Human), `mgr` (Manager).

## Worker

A Worker is the basic execution unit in AgentTeams — an AI Agent running in a Docker container with its own Matrix communication account and MinIO storage space.

### Basic Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: agentteams.io/v1beta1
kind: Worker
metadata:
  name: alice
spec:
  model: claude-sonnet-4-6        # LLM model
  identity: |                      # Worker public identity (generates IDENTITY.md)
    - Name: Alice
    - Specialization: DevOps, CI/CD pipeline management
  soul: |                          # Worker personality and values (generates SOUL.md)
    # Alice - DevOps Worker
    ## Personality
    - Methodical and detail-oriented, always double-checks before deploying
    - Proactive about potential risks, raises concerns early
    - Prefers automation over manual processes
    ## Values
    - Stability first: never sacrifice reliability for speed
    - Transparency: always explain what you're doing and why
  agents: |                        # Agent behavior rules (generates AGENTS.md)
    ## Behavior
    - Monitor CI/CD pipelines proactively
    - Alert on failures immediately
  skills:                          # AgentTeams built-in skills
    - github-operations
    - git-delegation
  mcpServers:                      # MCP servers callable via mcporter (url = full gateway endpoint)
    - name: github
      url: https://gateway.example.com/mcp-servers/github/mcp
      transport: http              # "http" (default, Streamable HTTP) or "sse"
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 250m
      memory: 512Mi
    limits:
      cpu: "2"
      memory: 2Gi
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `metadata.name` | string | Yes | — | Worker name, globally unique |
| `spec.model` | string | Yes | — | LLM model ID, e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `qwen3.5-plus` |
| `spec.runtime` | string | No | `openclaw` | Agent runtime: `openclaw`, `copaw`, or `hermes` |
| `spec.image` | string | No | — | Custom Docker image; if empty, the controller uses `AGENTTEAMS_WORKER_IMAGE` / `AGENTTEAMS_COPAW_WORKER_IMAGE` / `AGENTTEAMS_HERMES_WORKER_IMAGE` (defaults `agentteams/agentteams-worker:latest` / `agentteams/agentteams-copaw-worker:latest` / `agentteams/agentteams-hermes-worker:latest`) |
| `spec.identity` | string | No | — | Worker public identity (OpenClaw: generates IDENTITY.md; QwenPaw: merged into SOUL.md per controller) |
| `spec.soul` | string | No | — | Worker personality and values (generates SOUL.md) |
| `spec.agents` | string | No | — | Agent behavior rules, used to generate AGENTS.md |
| `spec.skills` | []string | No | — | Built-in skills, distributed by Manager |
| `spec.mcpServers` | []object | No | — | MCP servers callable via mcporter. Each item: `name` (required, map key in mcporter-servers.json), `url` (required, full gateway endpoint), `transport` (`http` default or `sse`). The controller injects `Authorization: Bearer <gatewayKey>`; gateway-side authorization is out of scope. |
| `spec.package` | string | No | — | Custom package URI: `file://`, `http(s)://`, `nacos://`, or controller-resolved `packages/{name}.zip` after upload |
| `spec.expose` | []object | No | — | Ports to expose via Higress gateway (see [Service Publishing](#service-publishing)) |
| `spec.channelPolicy` | object | No | — | Additive/deny-list overrides for group @mentions and DMs (see [Channel policy](#channel-policy-worker-and-team)) |
| `spec.state` | string | No | `Running` | Desired lifecycle: `Running`, `Sleeping`, or `Stopped` — controller reconciles containers toward this |
| `spec.resources` | object | No | install/backend defaults | CPU/memory requests and limits for this Worker Pod. Shape: `requests.cpu`, `requests.memory`, `limits.cpu`, `limits.memory` using Kubernetes quantity strings |

Changing `spec.resources` updates the Worker spec and recreates the managed container/Pod. Avoid resource changes while a Worker is actively processing a task.

### identity / soul / agents vs package

There are two ways to configure a Worker's identity and behavior:

- **Inline**: Define `spec.identity`, `spec.soul`, and `spec.agents` directly in the YAML. The Controller generates the corresponding IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md, and AGENTS.md. Best for lightweight configurations.
- **Package**: Provide a ZIP via `spec.package` containing the full config (IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, custom skills, Dockerfile, etc.). Best for complex setups requiring custom skills or system dependencies.

When both are set, inline fields override the corresponding files in the package. This allows you to use a package as a base template while customizing specific aspects via YAML — for example, importing a shared package but overriding `soul` to give the Worker a unique role definition.

### Built-in Skills vs Custom Skills

`spec.skills` refers to AgentTeams platform built-in capabilities, distributed by the Manager via `push-worker-skills.sh` to the Worker's MinIO space.

For custom skills, use `spec.package` to provide a ZIP containing a `skills/` directory. Built-in and custom skills are merged without conflict.

### Worker with Custom Package

```yaml
apiVersion: agentteams.io/v1beta1
kind: Worker
metadata:
  name: devops-alice
spec:
  model: claude-sonnet-4-6
  runtime: openclaw
  skills: [github-operations]
  mcpServers:
    - name: github
      url: https://gateway.example.com/mcp-servers/github/mcp
  package: file://./devops-alice.zip    # Contains custom SOUL.md, skills, Dockerfile, etc.
```

### Worker Creation Flow

When the Controller receives a Worker resource, it executes:

1. Resolve `spec.package` (if present) — download and extract to a temp directory
2. Register a Matrix account and create a communication Room (Manager + Admin + Worker)
3. Create a MinIO user and bucket, configure Higress gateway authorization
4. Generate `openclaw.json` config (including `groupAllowFrom` permission matrix)
5. Push all config files (SOUL.md, skills, crons, etc.) to MinIO
6. Update Worker status
7. Reconcile the Worker container

### Worker Status

| Phase | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Pending | Resource created, waiting for Controller to process |
| Running | Container running, Agent online (matches desired `spec.state` when healthy) |
| Sleeping | Desired or actual sleep state — container stopped, can be woken |
| Updating | Spec or infra change in progress |
| Stopped | Desired stopped state reconciled |
| Failed | Creation or runtime failure — check `status.message` |

**Status fields (subset):** `status.observedGeneration`, `status.matrixUserID`, `status.roomID`, `status.containerState`, `status.lastHeartbeat`, `status.message`, `status.exposedPorts` (per-port `domain` after expose).

## Team

A Team is AgentTeams's collaboration unit, consisting of one Team Leader and one or more Team Workers. The Manager delegates tasks to the Team Leader, who handles decomposition, assignment, and aggregation — achieving team-level autonomy.

### Basic Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: agentteams.io/v1beta1
kind: Team
metadata:
  name: alpha-team
spec:
  description: Full-stack development team
  heartbeatEvery: 30m
  workerMembers:
    - name: alpha-lead
      role: team_leader
    - name: alpha-dev
      role: worker
    - name: alpha-qa
      role: worker
```

Create `alpha-lead`, `alpha-dev`, and `alpha-qa` as Worker resources first. Model, runtime, image, resources, identity, skills, MCP servers, package, channel policy, and lifecycle state belong only to each Worker CR.

### Field Reference

**Team-level fields:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `metadata.name` | string | Yes | Team name, globally unique |
| `spec.description` | string | No | Team description |
| `spec.peerMentions` | bool | No | If `true` (default), team Workers may @mention each other in group rooms |
| `spec.channelPolicy` | object | No | Team-wide overrides for group/DM allow-deny lists (same shape as Worker `channelPolicy`) |
| `spec.admin` | object | No | Team-specific human admin (`name` required; `matrixUserId` optional). Defaults to global Admin when omitted |
| `spec.humanMembers` | []object | No | Additional human Team members. In this version, `role: coordinator` members join the Team Room and can assign work there like the Team Admin |
| `spec.workerMembers` | []object | Yes | References to existing Worker resources; exactly one entry must have `role: team_leader` |
| `spec.workerMembers[].name` | string | Yes | Referenced Worker resource name |
| `spec.workerMembers[].role` | string | Yes | `team_leader` or `worker` |
| `spec.heartbeatEvery` | string | No | Team Leader heartbeat interval hint |

### What Makes Team Leader Special

A Team Leader is essentially a Worker container, but with key differences:

- Uses the `team-leader-agent` template (SOUL.md.tmpl + AGENTS.md + HEARTBEAT.md)
- Has canonical Team Leader skills: `team-coordination` for strategy, `project-management` for Project state and ready-node resolution, and `task-management` for Worker task delegation
- Does not install the older `team-project-management`, `team-task-coordination`, or `team-task-management` compatibility aliases into new Team Leader workspaces; existing workspaces that already copied those aliases keep their local files until explicitly upgraded or recreated
- Does NOT have Manager-exclusive skills like `worker-management` or `mcp-server-management`
- Referenced with `role: "team_leader"` in `Team.spec.workerMembers`
- Follows a delegation-first principle — always assigns tasks to team Workers, never executes domain tasks itself

### Team Leader AGENTS.md Assembly

The Team Leader's AGENTS.md is assembled in three layers, each managed independently:

```
<!-- agentteams-builtin-start -->
[Builtin: Team Leader workspace rules, task flow, skills reference]
<!-- agentteams-builtin-end -->

<!-- agentteams-team-context-start -->
## Coordination
- Upstream coordinator: @manager:{domain}
- Team Admin: @admin:{domain}
- Team: alpha-team
- Team members: alpha-dev, alpha-qa
<!-- agentteams-team-context-end -->

[User-provided content from spec.agents (if any)]
```

- The builtin section is auto-managed by AgentTeams and updated on upgrades
- The team context is auto-injected with the team name, members, coordinator info, heartbeat interval, and worker idle timeout
- User-provided `spec.agents` content is placed after both sections and preserved across updates

### Room Topology

Creating a Team produces the following Matrix Rooms:

```
Leader Room:   Manager + Global Admin + Leader        ← Manager-to-Leader communication channel
Team Room:     Leader + Team Admin + W1 + W2 + ...    ← Leader-to-Workers collaboration space
Worker Room:   Leader + Team Admin + Worker           ← Leader-to-individual-Worker private chat
Leader DM:     Team Admin ↔ Leader                    ← Team management channel
```

Key design: the Team Room does NOT include the Manager, establishing a delegation boundary. The Manager communicates with the Leader only through the Leader Room and never reaches into the team directly.

### Task Flow

```
Admin assigns task → Manager
  ↓
Manager semantically chooses a matching Team from its name, description, Leader, and Workers
  ↓
Manager creates task spec, @mentions Leader
  ↓
Leader decomposes into sub-tasks, assigns to team Workers
  ↓
Workers complete execution, @mention Leader
  ↓
Leader aggregates results, @mentions Manager
  ↓
Manager notifies Admin
```

Team matching is not backed by structured team-level matching/filtering fields
such as `domain`, `expertise`, or `capabilities` on the Team object. Worker-level
`skills` can still describe individual members, but Manager delegation is based
on semantic judgement over the Team name, `spec.description`, Leader name, and
Worker names rather than a structured Team filter.

### Team Status

| Phase | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Pending | Resource created, waiting for Controller to process |
| Active | Leader and Workers reconciled successfully |
| Degraded | Some Workers unavailable or not ready; Leader may still run |
| Failed | Reconciliation error — check `status.message` |

**Status fields:** `teamRoomID`, `leaderDMRoomID`, `leaderReady`, `readyWorkers`, `totalWorkers`, `workerExposedPorts` (map of worker name → exposed port statuses).

### Team Admin

You can assign a dedicated admin (Team Admin) for a Team, replacing the global Admin for team management:

```yaml
spec:
  admin:
    name: pm-zhang
    matrixUserId: "@pm-zhang:domain"
```

If not specified, the global Admin is used by default. The Team Admin is invited to the Team Room and Leader DM, and can communicate directly with the Leader on team matters.

### Team Members

Use `spec.humanMembers` to add human members who are part of the Team but are not Workers. The first supported member role is `coordinator`: the member is invited to the Team Room, and Leader/Workers accept their @mentions there as authorized task assignment. Leader DM remains limited to the Team Admin and Leader.

```yaml
spec:
  admin:
    name: pm-zhang
    matrixUserId: "@pm-zhang:domain"
  humanMembers:
    - name: tech-lead-li
      matrixUserId: "@tech-lead-li:domain"
      role: coordinator
```

## Manager

The **Manager** resource describes the AgentTeams Manager Agent — the coordinator that receives instructions from Admin and orchestrates Workers and Teams. It uses the same API group/version as other resources and is reconciled by `agentteams-controller` (update image, SOUL/AGENTS, skills, MCP authorization, optional package, and desired `state`).

### Basic configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: agentteams.io/v1beta1
kind: Manager
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  model: qwen3.5-plus
  runtime: openclaw
  soul: |
    # Manager — coordination focus
  agents: |
    # Optional AGENTS.md overrides
  skills:
    - worker-management
  mcpServers:
    - name: github
      url: https://gateway.example.com/mcp-servers/github/mcp
  config:
    heartbeatInterval: 15m
    workerIdleTimeout: 720m
    notifyChannel: admin-dm
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 1Gi
    limits:
      cpu: "3"
      memory: 5Gi
  # state: Running   # optional: Running | Sleeping | Stopped
```

### Field reference

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `metadata.name` | string | Yes | — | Manager resource name (often `default` for the primary instance) |
| `spec.model` | string | Yes | — | LLM model ID |
| `spec.runtime` | string | No | `openclaw` | `openclaw` or `copaw` (Hermes is **not** a supported Manager runtime) |
| `spec.image` | string | No | — | Custom Manager image; empty uses deployment default |
| `spec.soul` | string | No | — | Custom SOUL.md content |
| `spec.agents` | string | No | — | Custom AGENTS.md content |
| `spec.skills` | []string | No | — | On-demand Manager skills to enable |
| `spec.mcpServers` | []object | No | — | MCP servers callable via mcporter. Each item: `name`, `url`, `transport` (`http`/`sse`). Gateway-side authorization is out of scope. |
| `spec.package` | string | No | — | Package URI (`file://`, `http(s)://`, `nacos://`) |
| `spec.state` | string | No | `Running` | Desired lifecycle: `Running`, `Sleeping`, `Stopped` |
| `spec.resources` | object | No | install/backend defaults | CPU/memory requests and limits for the Manager Pod. Shape: `requests.cpu`, `requests.memory`, `limits.cpu`, `limits.memory` |
| `spec.config.heartbeatInterval` | string | No | — | Heartbeat check interval (e.g. `15m`) |
| `spec.config.workerIdleTimeout` | string | No | — | Idle timeout before auto-sleep (e.g. `720m`) |
| `spec.config.notifyChannel` | string | No | — | Notification channel (e.g. `admin-dm`) |

### Manager status

| Phase | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Pending | Awaiting first successful reconcile |
| Running | Manager Agent healthy |
| Sleeping / Stopped | Desired lifecycle states |
| Updating | Spec or rollout in progress |
| Failed | Error — see `status.message` |

**Other status fields:** `observedGeneration`, `matrixUserID`, `roomID`, `containerState`, `version`.

## Human

A Human resource represents a real person. Upon creation, a Matrix account is automatically registered and the user is invited to the appropriate Rooms based on their permission level, enabling human-AI collaboration.

### Basic Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: agentteams.io/v1beta1
kind: Human
metadata:
  name: john
spec:
  displayName: John Doe
  email: john@example.com
  permissionLevel: 2
  accessibleTeams: [alpha-team]
  accessibleWorkers: []
  note: Frontend lead
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `metadata.name` | string | Yes | — | User identifier, globally unique |
| `spec.displayName` | string | Yes | — | Display name |
| `spec.email` | string | No | — | Email for sending credentials |
| `spec.permissionLevel` | int | Yes | — | Permission level: 1, 2, or 3 |
| `spec.accessibleTeams` | []string | No | — | Accessible Team list (effective for L2) |
| `spec.accessibleWorkers` | []string | No | — | Accessible standalone Worker list (effective for L2/L3) |
| `spec.note` | string | No | — | Notes |

### Three-Level Permission Model

Permission levels are inclusive — higher levels include all permissions of lower levels.

**Level 1 — Admin Equivalent**

Can talk to all roles in the system, including Manager, all Team Leaders, and all Workers. `accessibleTeams` and `accessibleWorkers` fields are ignored.

Use case: CTO, VP of Engineering.

```yaml
spec:
  permissionLevel: 1
```

**Level 2 — Team-Scoped**

Can talk to specified Teams' Leaders and all their Workers, plus specified standalone Workers.

Use case: Product manager, team member.

```yaml
spec:
  permissionLevel: 2
  accessibleTeams: [alpha-team, beta-team]
  accessibleWorkers: [standalone-dev]
```

**Level 3 — Worker-Only**

Can only talk to specified Workers. `accessibleTeams` field is ignored.

Use case: External collaborator, specialized staff.

```yaml
spec:
  permissionLevel: 3
  accessibleWorkers: [alice, bob]
```

### How Permissions Work

Human permissions are enforced through two mechanisms:

1. **Room invitations**: The Human is invited to the corresponding Matrix Rooms
2. **groupAllowFrom**: The Human's Matrix ID is added to the `openclaw.json` config of the corresponding Agents — Agents only respond to @mentions from whitelisted users

| Level | groupAllowFrom Changes | Room Invitations |
|-------|----------------------|------------------|
| L1 | Added to Manager + all Leaders + all Workers | All Rooms |
| L2 | Added to specified Teams' Leaders + Workers + specified standalone Workers | Specified Team Rooms + Worker Rooms |
| L3 | Added to specified Workers | Specified Worker Rooms |

### Human Creation Flow

1. Register a Matrix account (random password auto-generated)
2. Calculate which Agents need modification based on permissionLevel
3. Update `groupAllowFrom` in each affected Agent's `openclaw.json`
4. Invite the Human to the corresponding Rooms
5. Update Human status
6. Push updated configs to MinIO
7. Send a welcome email (if SMTP and email are configured)

### Automatic Welcome Email

When `spec.email` is set and SMTP is configured, a welcome email is automatically sent after the Human account is created, containing all the information needed to log in:

```
Subject: Welcome to AgentTeams - Your Account Details

Hi {displayName},

Your AgentTeams account has been created:

  Username: {matrix_user_id}
  Password: {generated_password}
  Login URL: {element_web_url}

Please log in and change your password immediately.

— AgentTeams
```

SMTP is configured via environment variables in the Manager container:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AGENTTEAMS_SMTP_HOST` | SMTP server address |
| `AGENTTEAMS_SMTP_PORT` | SMTP port |
| `AGENTTEAMS_SMTP_USER` | SMTP username |
| `AGENTTEAMS_SMTP_PASS` | SMTP password |
| `AGENTTEAMS_SMTP_FROM` | Sender address |

If SMTP is not configured or `spec.email` is empty, email sending is skipped without affecting account creation. The initial password is still recorded in `status.initialPassword` and can be retrieved via `agt get human <name>`.

### Notes

- Humans don't need containers, MinIO spaces, or Higress authorization — only a Matrix account and Room permissions
- Target Teams must exist before creating an L2 Human
- Target Workers must exist before creating an L3 Human
- Changing permissionLevel triggers a full recalculation of groupAllowFrom

## Package URI

Both Workers and Team Workers support custom configuration packages via `spec.package`. Three URI formats are supported:

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `file://` | `file://./alice.zip` | Local file, transferred via `docker cp` |
| `http(s)://` | `https://example.com/worker.zip` | Remote download |
| `nacos://` | `nacos://host:8848/ns/worker-xxx/v1` | Pulled from Nacos |
| (upload) | `packages/<name>.zip` | After `POST /api/v1/packages`, the controller returns a URI under `packages/` consumed by `spec.package` |

Nacos URI format: `nacos://[user:pass@]host:port/{namespace}/{agentspec-name}[/{version}|/label:{label}]`

### Package Directory Structure

Regardless of URI format, the extracted package follows a unified structure:

```
{package}/
├── manifest.json           # Package metadata (required)
├── Dockerfile              # Custom image build (optional)
├── config/
│   ├── SOUL.md             # Worker identity and role definition
│   ├── AGENTS.md           # Agent behavior rules
│   ├── MEMORY.md           # Long-term memory
│   └── memory/             # Memory files directory
├── skills/                 # Custom skills
│   └── <skill-name>/
│       └── SKILL.md
└── crons/
    └── jobs.json           # Scheduled tasks
```

### manifest.json

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "source": {
    "openclaw_version": "2026.3.x",
    "hostname": "my-server",
    "os": "Ubuntu 22.04",
    "created_at": "2026-03-18T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "worker": {
    "suggested_name": "my-worker",
    "model": "qwen3.5-plus",
    "runtime": "openclaw",
    "base_image": "agentteams/worker-agent:latest",
    "apt_packages": ["ffmpeg"],
    "pip_packages": [],
    "npm_packages": []
  }
}
```

`worker.runtime` (`openclaw`, `copaw`, or `hermes`) is honored by `agt apply worker --zip`
and overridden by an explicit `--runtime` flag.

## Operations

### agentteams-apply.sh — Declarative Apply (Recommended)

Runs on the host, copying YAML into the Manager container and invoking `agt apply -f …`:

```bash
# Create/update resources (each document is POST or PUT in order)
bash install/agentteams-apply.sh -f worker.yaml

# Multi-document file (use --- separators)
bash install/agentteams-apply.sh -f company-setup.yaml
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-f <path>` | YAML resource file (required); multiple `-f` flags allowed |

`agt apply -f` walks YAML documents **in file order** and calls the REST API per kind (`Worker` → `/api/v1/workers`, `Team` → `/api/v1/teams`, `Human` → `/api/v1/humans`, `Manager` → `/api/v1/managers`). Put dependencies first yourself (e.g. define Teams before Humans that reference `accessibleTeams`). **`--prune` and `--dry-run` are not implemented** in the current CLI — remove extras with `agt delete …` or equivalent APIs.

### agentteams-import.sh — Imperative Import

For importing Workers from ZIP packages:

```bash
# Import from local ZIP
bash install/agentteams-import.sh worker --name alice --zip ./alice.zip

# Import from URL
bash install/agentteams-import.sh worker --name alice --zip https://example.com/alice.zip

# Import from Nacos
bash install/agentteams-import.sh worker --name alice --package nacos://host:8848/ns/alice/v1
bash install/agentteams-import.sh worker --name alice --package nacos://host:8848/ns/alice/label:latest

# Create without a package
bash install/agentteams-import.sh worker --name bob --model claude-sonnet-4-6 \
    --skills github-operations,git-delegation

# Note: mcpServers must be configured via YAML manifest (see Worker spec above).
#       The --mcp-servers flag has been removed — the new schema requires
#       {name, url, transport} per server and is not expressible as a CSV string.
```

### agt CLI — In-Container Management

Operate directly inside the Manager container (or via `docker exec`):

```bash
# List all resources
docker exec agentteams-manager agt get workers
docker exec agentteams-manager agt get teams
docker exec agentteams-manager agt get humans
docker exec agentteams-manager agt get managers

# View a single resource
docker exec agentteams-manager agt get worker alice

# Delete a resource
docker exec agentteams-manager agt delete worker alice
docker exec agentteams-manager agt delete team alpha-team
docker exec agentteams-manager agt delete human john
docker exec agentteams-manager agt delete manager default
```

### HTTP API — Cloud Management

The `agentteams-controller` exposes a REST API (default `:8090`) used by the `agt` CLI. Typical resources:

```
GET    /api/v1/workers
POST   /api/v1/workers
PUT    /api/v1/workers/{name}
DELETE /api/v1/workers/{name}

GET    /api/v1/teams
POST   /api/v1/teams
...

GET    /api/v1/managers
POST   /api/v1/managers
PUT    /api/v1/managers/{name}
DELETE /api/v1/managers/{name}
```

> **Note:** In typical embedded deployments, port 8090 is reachable from inside the Manager container (`localhost:8090`). In Kubernetes (`AGENTTEAMS_KUBE_MODE=incluster`), expose the controller via a Service as needed.

## Batch Deployment

Use `---` separators to define multiple resources in one file. **`agt apply -f` applies documents sequentially in the order they appear** — it does not sort by kind. Create every referenced Worker before its Team, then put Teams before Humans that list `accessibleTeams`.

Deletion order is not automatic: use `agt delete` per resource (respect dependencies: e.g. delete Humans before Teams they reference, if your deployment requires it).

One-command deployment:

```bash
bash install/agentteams-apply.sh -f company-setup.yaml
```

For subsequent changes, edit the YAML and re-apply. To remove a resource, use `agt delete <kind> <name>` (or the REST API).

## Controller Architecture

### Processing Flow

```
Entry point (agentteams-apply.sh / HTTP API / agt CLI)
  ↓
YAML written to MinIO agentteams-config/{kind}/{name}.yaml
  ↓
mc mirror syncs to local filesystem (10-second interval)
  ↓
fsnotify detects file changes → parses YAML → writes to kine (SQLite)
  ↓
controller-runtime informer detects changes → triggers Reconciler
  ↓
Reconciler executes scripts (create-worker.sh / create-team.sh / create-human.sh)
```

### Reconciler Actions

| Reconciler | CREATE | UPDATE | DELETE |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Worker | Create container + Matrix account + MinIO space | model change → regenerate config; skills change → re-push | Stop container + clean up resources |
| Team | Validate and link existing Workers + create Team Room | `workerMembers` change → update membership and coordination context | Remove Team Room and coordination context; preserve Worker CRs and runtimes |
| Human | Register Matrix account + configure permissions + send email | permissionLevel change → recalculate groupAllowFrom | Remove from all groupAllowFrom → kick from Rooms |
| Manager | Provision/update Manager Agent config + runtime | model/skills/package/state → reconcile | Tear down managed Manager resources per backend |

All resources use the Kubernetes finalizer pattern to ensure cleanup before deletion.

## Service Publishing

Workers can expose HTTP services running inside their containers to the outside world via the Higress gateway. Add `spec.expose` to a Worker's configuration to publish container ports — the Controller automatically creates the necessary Higress domain, DNS service source, and route.

### How It Works

Each exposed port gets an auto-generated domain:

```
worker-{name}-{port}-local.agentteams.io
```

For example, worker `alice` exposing port `8080` becomes accessible at `worker-alice-8080-local.agentteams.io`.

The Controller creates three Higress resources per exposed port:
1. **Domain**: `worker-{name}-{port}-local.agentteams.io`
2. **DNS Service Source**: points to the worker container via network alias `{name}.local`
3. **Route**: forwards all requests on the domain to the worker's port

When the expose configuration is removed or the Worker is deleted, all associated Higress resources are automatically cleaned up.

### Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: agentteams.io/v1beta1
kind: Worker
metadata:
  name: alice
spec:
  model: qwen3.5-plus
  expose:
    - port: 8080
    - port: 3000
```

**Expose field reference:**

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `expose[].port` | int | Yes | — | Container port to expose |
| `expose[].protocol` | string | No | `http` | Protocol: `http` or `grpc` |

### Workers referenced by a Team

`expose` remains Worker-owned. Configure it on the Worker CRs, then reference those Workers from the Team:

```yaml
apiVersion: agentteams.io/v1beta1
kind: Worker
metadata:
  name: lead
spec:
  model: qwen3.5-plus
---
apiVersion: agentteams.io/v1beta1
kind: Worker
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  model: qwen3.5-plus
  expose:
    - port: 8080
---
apiVersion: agentteams.io/v1beta1
kind: Team
metadata:
  name: dev-team
spec:
  workerMembers:
    - name: lead
      role: team_leader
    - name: backend
      role: worker
```

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Expose ports via CLI flag
agt apply worker --name alice --model qwen3.5-plus --expose 8080,3000

# Remove exposed ports (re-apply without --expose)
agt apply worker --name alice --model qwen3.5-plus
```

### Use Cases

- **Web App Preview**: A Worker develops a web application and exposes it for the Admin or other team members to preview
- **API Service**: A Worker runs a backend API that other Workers or external systems need to access
- **Development Server**: Expose a dev server for real-time testing during development

### Notes

- The worker container must be running and the service must be listening on the specified port before it can be accessed
- Domains are auto-generated; custom domains are not yet supported
- No authentication is configured on exposed routes (public access within the network)
- Removing a port from `spec.expose` and re-applying will clean up the corresponding Higress resources

### Two Deployment Modes

| Dimension | embedded (default) | incluster (K8s) |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Config storage | MinIO `agentteams-config/` | K8s etcd (CRDs stored directly in K8s) |
| Controller detection | fsnotify → kine → informer | controller-runtime watches K8s API directly |
| Switch via | `AGENTTEAMS_KUBE_MODE=embedded` | `AGENTTEAMS_KUBE_MODE=incluster` |

## Channel policy (Worker and Team)

`channelPolicy` augments the default allow lists used when generating Agent configs (group @mentions and DMs). It is **additive and subtractive on top of defaults**, not a full replacement.

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `groupAllowExtra` | Extra Matrix user IDs (or short names resolved by the controller) allowed for group @mentions |
| `groupDenyExtra` | Deny list for group @mentions (deny wins over allow) |
| `dmAllowExtra` | Extra IDs allowed for direct messages |
| `dmDenyExtra` | Deny list for DMs |

Set `spec.channelPolicy` on a Worker for per-member policy, and `spec.channelPolicy` on a Team for Team-wide policy.

## Communication Permission Matrix

AgentTeams uses the `groupAllowFrom` field in `openclaw.json` to control which @mentions each Agent accepts, enabling fine-grained communication permissions.

| Role | groupAllowFrom includes |
|------|------------------------|
| Manager | Admin, all Team Leaders, all standalone Workers, Human L1 |
| Team Leader | Manager, Admin, all team Workers, Human L1, Human L2 for this Team |
| Team Worker | Leader, Admin, Human L1, Human L2 for this Team, specified Human L3 |
| Standalone Worker | Manager, Admin, Human L1, specified Human L2/L3 |

Key rules:
- Manager does not penetrate Teams — communicates only with the Leader, never directly with team Workers
- Team Workers only recognize their Leader — groupAllowFrom does not include Manager
- Permissions are inclusive — Human L1 > L2 > L3, higher levels include all lower-level permissions
- Standalone Workers maintain the existing pattern — communicate directly with Manager

## FAQ

**Q: Can Teams and standalone Workers coexist?**

Yes. Teams and standalone Workers coexist in the same AgentTeams instance. The Manager decides whether to delegate to a Team Leader or assign directly to a standalone Worker based on the task domain.

**Q: What happens when a Human's permissionLevel is changed?**

The Controller recalculates the Human's groupAllowFrom across all affected Agents, removes old permissions, adds new ones, and updates Room invitations.

**Q: Can a Team Worker belong to multiple Teams?**

No. Each Worker can only belong to one Team (or be a standalone Worker).

**Q: What if the target Team doesn't exist yet when creating an L2 Human?**

The Controller marks the Human as Pending and automatically backfills permissions once the target Team is created.

**Q: Is there a `--prune` mode for declarative apply?**

Not in the current `agt apply` CLI. List resources with `agt get …` and delete explicitly, or automate against the REST API.
