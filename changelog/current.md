# Changelog (Unreleased)

Record image-affecting changes to `manager/`, `worker/`, `copaw/`, `hermes/`, `openclaw-base/`, and `agentteams-controller/` here before the next release.

---

**What's New**

- **Manager native multi-agent delegation invariant**: Require an authorized complex multi-agent request to load the existing Team delegation references, select a Team/Leader from the live roster, complete the finite-task file/MinIO/state/message handoff, and report only after completion or a concrete blocker.
- **Custom model capability overrides**: `AGENTTEAMS_MODEL_VISION` and `AGENTTEAMS_MODEL_REASONING` env vars let deployments override vision and reasoning capabilities for custom models not in the built-in presets table (e.g. local multimodal models like `qwen3.6-27b-fp8`).

**Bug Fixes**

- **CoPaw Team assignment handoff**: Return the required Team Room `message` action from `taskflow(delegate_task)`, normalize Worker aliases from the Team roster, refresh Controller-managed runtime context every minute, and reroute assignment replies from non-Team rooms to the Team Room. ([#1120](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/AgentTeams/pull/1120))
- **Docker Worker ServiceAccount token rotation**: Project short-lived tokens into per-Worker Docker volumes, refresh the token file atomically without recreating running Workers, and remove the credential volume with the Worker.
- **Worker port exposure CLI**: Encode `--expose` values as numeric ports and reject invalid or out-of-range inputs before create, update, or apply requests reach the Controller.
- **QwenPaw MCP policy startup convergence**: Persist built-in plugin MCP policies before runtime desired-state reloads so a replacement QwenPaw workspace cannot retain the pre-policy interactive approval handler.
- **QwenPaw Team policy and runtime-aware acceptance**: Merge Team and Worker channel-policy overrides into QwenPaw `runtime.yaml`, wait for public plugin/API state before integration assertions, and verify prompt/config files from the runtime location that consumes them.
- **QwenPaw 2.0 tool execution**: Preserve QwenPaw's asynchronous tool-result stream while sanitizing output, and allow only the built-in TeamHarness and Workerflow MCP drivers to run without an unavailable interactive approval prompt.
- **QwenPaw HITL persistence**: Persist bounded approval state atomically, restore non-expired requests after runtime restart, retry unavailable Matrix notifications, and flush the state before Worker shutdown.
- **QwenPaw package and Team storage access**: Preserve referenced members' effective Team name across independent Worker reconciles, update MinIO policies without detaching active Workers, revoke access on detach, and grant Workers read-only access to centrally uploaded AgentSpec packages.
- **QwenPaw inline prompt compatibility**: Project Worker identity, SOUL, and AGENTS content through runtime desired state and apply it to both the native QwenPaw workspace and the Worker root storage contract.
- **Integration failure diagnostics**: Export AgentTeams container state and timestamped logs with CI artifacts, classify QwenPaw startup errors without exposing their message contents, and stop the TeamHarness shard after startup failures instead of hiding the cause behind cascading timeouts.
- **QwenPaw local startup readiness**: Select and propagate the QwenPaw Worker image across install backends, then wait for the runtime-owned `runtime/runtime.yaml` object before creating a local Docker Worker.
- **QwenPaw 2.0 runtime compatibility**: Adapt the QwenPaw Worker image, custom Matrix Channel, and native plugins to QwenPaw 2.0.1 startup and schema contracts.
- **Multimodal model image support**: Add `supports_multimodal` and `supports_image` to `agents.defaults` in generated openclaw.json when the selected model supports image input, so QwenPaw does not strip images at the framework layer. Fixes #931.
- **Install script model env passthrough**: Pass custom model override env vars to the Controller container so that `AGENTTEAMS_MODEL_VISION` and related settings actually reach the config generator.
- **Bridge model capability propagation**: Propagate model `input` modalities from openclaw.json through `_write_providers_json()` so QwenPaw's `ModelInfo` receives `supports_image`/`supports_video`/`supports_multimodal` flags instead of relying on fail-open defaults.
- **Manager diagnostic loops**: Manager prompts and Worker lifecycle guidance stop repeated no-op troubleshooting commands and treat a missing Worker in `agt get workers` as the deletion boundary instead of looping on Matrix room probes. ([#975](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/AgentTeams/pull/975))

**Bug 修复**

- **CoPaw Team 任务分配交接**：由 `taskflow(delegate_task)` 返回必须执行的 Team Room `message` 动作，根据 Team roster 规范化 Worker 别名，每分钟刷新 Controller 管理的运行时上下文，并将非 Team Room 中的任务分配回复重定向到 Team Room。([#1120](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/AgentTeams/pull/1120))
- **Worker 端口暴露 CLI**：将 `--expose` 参数编码为数值端口，并在创建、更新或应用请求到达 Controller 前拒绝无效或越界输入。
- **Manager 诊断循环**：Manager 提示和 Worker 生命周期指引会停止重复执行无效果的排障命令，并以 `agt get workers` 不再列出目标 Worker 作为删除完成边界，避免继续循环探测 Matrix Room。([#975](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/AgentTeams/pull/975))
