# to ask admin for FOUR inputs (name / runtime / SOUL / skills) before running
# `agt create worker`, and to NOT invent defaults. A vague prompt that only
# names the worker is therefore a coin flip — sometimes the LLM follows
# SKILL.md strictly and replies with a 4-question confirmation, never calling
# the CLI, and downstream assertions (consumer / SOUL.md) silently fail. We
# avoid that by spelling out all four inputs and telling Manager to skip
# confirmation, so the test exercises actual Worker creation rather than the
# LLM's confirmation-loop behavior.
#
# The runtime is explicit for the same reason: CI matrix runtime must win over
# any rendered fallback text the Manager may have cached in its workspace.
