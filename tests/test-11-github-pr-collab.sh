# Verifies: A develops feature & creates PR, B reviews & comments on GitHub PR,
#           A fixes issues, C adds tests and verifies they pass.
#
# This test validates:
# 1. GitHub PR workflow across multiple workers
# 2. PR review comments via GitHub API
# 3. Non-linear task dependencies (revision flow)
# 4. Cross-worker coordination via GitHub

# Create the task description
TASK_DESCRIPTION="I need a collaborative GitHub PR workflow test:

**Scenario**: Implement a simple calculator module with PR-based collaboration

**Phase 1 - Feature Development (Worker A: alice)**:
1. Create branch '${FEATURE_BRANCH}' from main
2. Create file 'src/calculator.js' with add(a,b) and multiply(a,b) functions
3. Create Pull Request titled 'feat: add calculator module'

**Phase 2 - Code Review (Worker B: bob)**:
1. Review the PR on GitHub
2. Add a review COMMENT on the PR requesting: 'Please add input validation for negative numbers'
3. Report REVISION_NEEDED so alice can fix

**Phase 3 - Fix Implementation (Worker A: alice)**:
1. Update the calculator.js to add input validation
2. Push the fix to the same branch (new commit)
3. Report SUCCESS

**Phase 4 - Test Addition (Worker C: charlie)**:
1. Create branch '${TEST_BRANCH}' from alice's feature branch (after fix)
2. Add file 'tests/calculator.test.js' with unit tests
3. Verify tests would pass (since no actual test runner, just verify the test file is valid)
4. Create PR titled 'test: add calculator unit tests'
5. Report SUCCESS

GitHub repo: ${GITHUB_OWNER}/${GITHUB_REPO}

Please create workers alice (developer), bob (reviewer), and charlie (qa-tester) and coordinate this workflow.

For each worker creation, use these exact values — do not ask me to confirm any of them:
- alice: runtime=install default; SOUL/role='Developer who implements features in JavaScript and pushes commits'; skills='github-operations'
- bob: runtime=install default; SOUL/role='Code reviewer who inspects PRs for correctness and quality'; skills='github-operations'
- charlie: runtime=install default; SOUL/role='QA tester who writes unit tests and verifies behavior'; skills='github-operations'

If a worker already exists, reuse it instead of recreating. Proceed immediately."
