# agentteams-worker-agent

Lightweight Worker Agent container. Includes:

- **Worker Agent** (OpenClaw): Executes tasks, communicates via Matrix
- **mc**: MinIO Client for file sync with centralized storage
- **mcporter**: MCP tool CLI for calling external services (GitHub, etc.)

Workers are **stateless** -- all configuration and memory is stored in the centralized MinIO file system. A Worker can be destroyed and recreated at any time without losing state.

## Build

```bash
# Via Makefile (recommended)
make build-worker

# Or directly
docker build -t agentteams/worker-agent:latest .
```

## Run

Workers are created by the Manager Agent. The Manager provides the installation command:

```bash
../install/agentteams-install.sh worker \
  --name alice \
  --fs http://<MANAGER_IP>:9000 \
  --fs-key <ACCESS_KEY> \
  --fs-secret <SECRET_KEY>
```
